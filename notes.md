# General notes
- Good code structure and nice readme
- Nice visualization
- Would have liked a script to automatize the generation of reports for different sizes
- Nice usage of googletest and googlebenchmark


# Code
## Major
- You could have tried to use your matrix-matrix multiplication to develop at least the forward part of a neural network

## Minor
- You could have tried to benchmark the resuts for different sizes `constexpr size_t tileSize = 16;`
